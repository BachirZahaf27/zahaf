probleme with 3 conditions if else:


hi everyone so my goal is to create a window that can customize your character by choosing the name (nom)  your sex(sexe) your hight (taille) your hair color(Cheveux) and age,
when you enter all your element which is CONDITION1 you get a pop-up window that tells you the information you enter (nom,sexe,taille ...etc), even if you don't enter the age you still gonna end it by seeing the popup window of information which is CONDITION2, NOW when you don't enter anything which is CONDITION 3 and you click on the button "OK" you get a pop-up window to tell you "no information is entered", hopefully now you understand and I'm gonna send you photos and the hole code to maybe understand the comment is on french just translate it.

the first window is this:

the second is this:

condition 1 (all the element entered):

condition 2 (if all the element is entered but no the age) ALSO THE SAME THING JUST IN AGE IT GONNA BE "NULL" AUTO CUZ NOT SELECTED:

condition 3 (all the element is not entered and you click on OK or Anuller):

TIP: creat a pakacage and name it "ex03"


Finally, if you don't have the time it okay I don't like to force someone to do anything especially when he is helping me
